Integration between Visual Studio Code and Git:

Configure it as core editor (usually Git defaults to Vim)
  git config --global core.editor "code -w -n"
After this is configured as primary editor you can edit Git settings using:
  git config --global -e
Configure it as default Diff/Merge tool:
   [diff]
  tool = code-difftool
   [difftool "code-difftool"]
  cmd = code -w -n --diff $LOCAL $REMOTE
   
You can even overwrite Git Diff behaviour using it, but be aware is not so convenient!

  [diff]
  external = code -w -r --diff $1 $2

You can experiment with $LOCAL/$REMOTE/$BASE for file input.
Also you can still use old behaviour invoking:

  git diff --no-ext-diff # Show LESS diff
  git diff --name-only # List changed file names

For additional information use checkout git diff --help.
