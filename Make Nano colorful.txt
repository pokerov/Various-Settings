Since the default colurs found in 
/usr/share/nano/*.nanorc are not complete use the 
following procedure.

git clone https://github.com/nanorc/nanorc.git
cd nanorc
make install

Add these lines to ~/.nanorc:
include ~/.nano/syntax/html.nanorc
include ~/.nano/syntax/css.nanorc
include ~/.nano/syntax/php.nanorc
include ~/.nano/syntax/ALL.nanorc

Note: This will be installed only for current 
user. Root user will not benefit from these 
commands.
