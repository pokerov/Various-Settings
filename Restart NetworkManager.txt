When having troubles connecting to some wireless network or broadband one, often latest releases of 
NetworkManages crashes and cannot work properly with Qualcomm cards.

To restart the NetworkManager service (on system running systemd):

$ sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager.service

Note: To view what is the status of this service replace 'restart' with 'status'.
